  <h1 class="post-title">One Year of Shorthand</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2021-02-08</span>
  <p>Today marks one year since I started learning Gregg shorthand. I discovered
shorthand on February 8, 2020 while browsing Instagram.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-all-began">How it all began</h2>
<p>I was browsing the Instagram feed one day when I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/guy-sends-his-brother-a-doctors-scribble-as-a-joke-and-is-surprised-that-it-actually-means-something/86191899/?view=list">this post</a>
(the link it to eBaumsWorld.com where I later found the post again). One
particular picture which broke down the sounds in the word &quot;atrophied&quot; caught my
attention. I was intrigued by this novel system of writing in such a simplified
fashion.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I found the <a href="https://gregg-shorthand.com">Gregg Shorthand Blog</a> and applied to join. It had lots of good
practice material, but I didn't end up using much of it.</p>
<p>I ended up studying the script using <em>Gregg Shorthand Manual Simplified</em>, which
is the definitive guide on the subject. I managed to find an version on
Archive.org for free, but it was quite old. I later checked out the latest (2nd)
edition book from the library.</p>
<p>At the time, I was sure that this was going to be a hobby that would last no
more than a few weeks. I thought of gardening, juggling, and pen spinning, all
of which were hobbies that I tried for a while (a few months to a year) and then
gave up. Strangely enough, I didn't give up on shorthand and have kept it up for
one whole year.</p>
<h2 id="the-official-manual">The official manual</h2>
<p>I began by studying from the official manual. I would read a lesson every day
and study the new stroke/briefs as well as read the shorthand practice. It
wasn't until a few weeks in that I realized that I should practice writing as
well.</p>
<p>It took me about four months to go through the whole manual. The pace was not too
fast but fast enough to keep my on my toes. The first couple of weeks were a
huge struggle, as it took me a long time to decipher the symbols. After a while,
though, I subconsciously learned to recognize subtle patterns in the writing.
These patterns or rules aren't explicitly written out; rather, I learned them
through trial and error. In this regard, I believe a book like <em>Gregg Shorthand:
Manual for the Functional Method</em> would have been better for me. It doesn't
teach the rules explicitly; instead, it lets you figure out the rules through
trial and error. Although this book takes longer to go through all the shorthand
symbols, it may have been more enjoyable to read.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the book, I began dictating. I would read the practice
material (which is written in shorthand) and record myself. Then I would play
back the audio and write it down. This method of dictating and writing is the
method I found for practicing shorthand.</p>
<h2 id="business-language-is-boring">Business language is boring</h2>
<p>After I finished <em>Gregg Shorthand Manual Simplified</em>, I picked up <em>Gregg
Dictation Simplified</em>, which was the book most schools used after teaching with
the official manual. Shorthand, back when it was taught in high schools and
colleges, was something that required years to learn. It was usually split into
four courses spread out over four years.</p>
<p>I only kept up studying using this book for two months before I had to leave for
a twenty day trip. Upon return, I decided to change the way I practice because I
felt that the material in <em>Gregg Dictation Simplified</em> was way too boring.
Everything was about businesses (particularly collection letters) and I felt
that the business language was not useful to me.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-practice">What to practice?</h2>
<p>I stopped practicing shorthand for a while because I felt swamped with too many
things that I had to keep up with everyday. By October, however, I decided to
start again. I found I was pretty rusty but I didn't forget that much. I
practiced with quotes from <a href="https://play.typeracer.com">TypeRacer</a>, a website I also use to practice
stenography. I would do the same thing I did before: record myself reading a
quote and writing it down.</p>
<p>After doing that for two months, I switched practice material yet again because
I felt that the TypeRacer practice quotes were too random. I practiced writing
quotes from books for a month, but the literary material felt too difficult.
Finally, at the present time, I am practicing with material from famous speeches
(most inaugural addresses).</p>
<p>The biggest problem with practicing shorthand is that I don't know what to
practice with. Ideally, I would &quot;practice&quot; shorthand simply by using it in my
everyday note taking. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic and online learning,
I'm doing almost everything on my computer.</p>

<h4 id="official-books-gregg-dictation">Official books (<em>Gregg Dictation</em>)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pros:
<ul>
<li>Official practice material, will be the most completely in terms of the
shorthand techniques covered.</li>
<li>Already curated and ready for me to use; I don't need to spend time
finding stuff on my own</li>
<li>Almost everyone who learned shorthand used these materials</li>
<li>Contained writing/stroke accuracy exercises</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons:
<ul>
<li>The vocabulary/business language is not very useful to me</li>
<li>The books are hard to find because they are so old</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="typeracer">TypeRacer</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pros:

<ul>
<li>Quotes are short and about random subjects; the lack of context
surrounding individual quotes makes the shorthand reading unnecessarily
difficult.</li>
<li>Many quotes contain a lot of proper nouns which are annoying</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="speeches-other-verbal-sources">Speeches/other verbal sources</h4>

good for)</li>
<li>Tend to focus on one subject with consistent vocabulary and word choice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons:
<ul>
<li>Difficult to find good speeches with transcripts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-opinions-on-shorthand">My opinions on shorthand</h2>
<p>Shorthand is difficult to learn. This is a very niche skill that will only
benefit some people. I'm still not sure if the benefits I receive outweigh the
costs of learning such a massive system. There are other methods of writing
quickly (like <a href="http://easyscript.com/learnshorthand.asp">EasyScript</a>) that require much less time to learn and still
allow you to write reasonable quickly. However, the time and effort I put into
this skill now will continue to benefit me for the rest of my life.</p>
