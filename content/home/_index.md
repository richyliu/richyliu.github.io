# Hello!

I am Richard Liu, a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with interests in cybersecurity and embedded systems. In my spare time I like to go rock climbing and play piano and guitar. My past projects include a [security fuzzer integration with QEMU](http://github.com/richyliu/qemu-fuzzing) and an [apartment-hunting website](https://www.uiuc-apartments.com/)
