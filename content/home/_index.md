# Hello!

I am Richard Liu, a senior at Monta Vista High School with interests in web
development and functional programming. In my spare time I like to go
backpacking and skiing. Some of my more esoteric hobbies include stenography and
shorthand.

## John Muir Trail

I hiked the 220-mile John Muir Trail in California with my friend Daniel in
July-August 2020. Here are some nice pictures from the trip.
