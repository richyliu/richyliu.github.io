# Hello!

I am Richard Liu, a senior at Monta Vista High School with interests in web
development and functional programming. In my spare time I like to go
backpacking and skiing. Some of my more esoteric hobbies include stenography and
shorthand.

## John Muir Trail

I hiked the 220-mile John Muir Trail in California with my friend Daniel in
July-August 2020. Here are some 4K pictures you can use as wallpaper.

### Dynamic wallpaper

I took several pictures of [Guitar
Lake](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Guitar+Lake/@36.5767321,-118.3209751,14.96z/)
at various times throughout the day. I have put them together into a Dynamic
Wallpaper. Download the [HEIC file](guitar_lake.heic) and right click and select
"Set Desktop Picture" to use.

You can also download the individual images:
