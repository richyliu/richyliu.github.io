# Hello!

I am Richard Liu, a sophomore at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
with interests in cybersecurity, web development, and functional programming. In
my spare time I like to go rock climbing, backpacking, and skiing. Some of my
more esoteric hobbies include stenography and shorthand.
